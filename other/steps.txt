fill_slots_H
    newpuzzle = []
    slots = []
    for each row in puzzle:
        make a new row with logical vars DONE
        add new row to newpuzzle DONE
        SEPARATE THIS STEP INTO ANOTHER PASS FOR UNDERSTANDABILITY'S SAKE
        get all the slots from this row
        add these slots to slots (this might make lists of lists, perhaps leave it like that and flatten once done).
flip
fill_slots_V
    for each column:
        get all the slots
        you don't need to make them with logical vars because they already have them.
